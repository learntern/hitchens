Our mission is to ensure that every student out of college is equipped with the skills to land a job. 

We understand that degrees don't directly translate to skills. There is a disconnect between what is needed by organizations versus what is taught in the classroom. Hands-on learning although present is not enough to give confidence to both students and organizations. 

Born out of a need to solve this burning problem, we at LearnTern are in the process of building out a experiential learning platform to help students gain real-world skills. 

Right now we are starting out with just a vision, if you are someone who is passionate about education and reforming it â€” I invite you to connect with us and help us in anyway that you can!
